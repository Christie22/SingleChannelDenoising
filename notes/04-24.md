# Running experiments & Report
> semester project group meeting 24/04

### Progresses
#### Implementation
- better training logs
- models!
- lr scheduler
- metrics script
- real world noise support
#### Research
- attempted to train the models we set out to investigate
- tweaked the following parameters:
    - dataset size (# of SNRs)
    - dropout rate
    - learning rate
    - batch norm
    - data repr
- some pretty good audible results (tcn, rnn-conv)
#### Report
- added bib refs

### Roadmap
#### Research
- test combination of parameters
- use real world noises
#### Implementation
- denoising script
- real-time demo of some sort
- pesq metric
#### Report
- fill in stuff

### Challenges/Questions
- some models are unstable
- how to interpret/use results (currently on a single file-noise_variation basis)
- should we use the source evaluation metrics?

# Notes from 13/02

Process:
1. Treat data
2. Replicate state of the art
3. Implement techniques
4. Design experiment
5. Apply techniques
6. Evaluate performances


Things to figure out:
- Datasets (which one to use, how, etc)
- State of the art (baseline)
- Metrics for evaluation
- Preprocessing
- ML techniques to try


State of the art:
- Short-Time Spectral Amplitude Minimum Mean Square Error (STSA-MMSE)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Techniques:
- Long Short-Term Memory Based Recurrent Neural Networks (LTST)
- Permutation Invariant Training (PIT)

Metrics (performance measures)
- Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) [55]
- Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) [56, 57]
- Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR)
- Signal to Interferences Ratio (SIR)
- Signal to Artifact Ratio (SAR)[2, 58]
- Maximum Mean Envelope Linear Correlation (MMELC)
